Python Assignment

This assignment contains two directories: PyBank and PyPoll.  

PyBank analyzes the financial records for a company within an Excel CSV file.  The CSV file is named budget_data.csv.  Main.py is the main scrip to run for analysis.  Main.py within the PyBank directory reads the CSV file in dictionary form.  
It calculates:
    1. Total number of months
    2. Sum of the profit/losses over those months
    3. The average change in revenue for the months sans the first.  
    4. The month and totals for the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits/losses  
Main.py prints an output text file called analysis.txt in the Analysis directory.  The analyzed data is printed in both the terminal and in the output file.

PyPoll analyzes the election data for a small town within an Excel CSV file.  The CSV file is named election_data.csv.  Main.py is the main scrip to run for analysis. Main.py within the PyPoll directory reads the CSV file in dictionary form.

    2. Finds each candidate within the file using a list
    3. Counts the number of votes each candidiate received using a dictionary
