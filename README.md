Python Assignment

This assignment contains two directories: PyBank and PyPoll.  

PyBank analyzes the financial records for a company within an Excel CSV file.  The CSV file is named budget_data.csv.  Main.py within the PyBank directory reads the CSV file in dictionary form.  It then calculates the total number of months and the sum of the profit/losses over those months.  Also calculated is the average change in revenue for the months sans the first.  Lastly, the month and totals for the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits/losses is calculated.  Main.py also prints an output text file called analysis.txt in the Analysis directory.  The analyzed data is printed in both the terminal and in the output file.
